# FinalProject
This is the final project I created for CUS1172 - Web Application Development. It is a course query page that allows users to search different courses based on one of five different queries. To access this application, please use the Heroku link presented below:

Heroku: https://cus1172finalproject.herokuapp.com/demo/index_dev.html

The page features 5 query searches, which works as follows:
1. Search by course code:
2. Search by course title
3. Search by course instructor
4. Search by course level
5. Search by course instructor and level
