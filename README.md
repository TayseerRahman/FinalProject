# FinalProject
This is the final project I created for CUS1172 - Web Application Development. It is a course query application that allows users to search different courses based on one of five different queries. To access this application, please use the Heroku link presented below:

Heroku: https://cus1172finalproject.herokuapp.com/demo/index_dev.html

As mentioned above, this page works by utilizing the following 5 query searches:
1. Search by course code:

Type in "CUS" followed by either a 3-digit number (indicates a graduate course) or a 4-digit number (indicates an undergraduate course).

Ex: "CUS750" for Robotics, or "CUS1166" for Software Engineering", or simply "CUS" to access the entire course directory.

2. Search by course title:

Type in the name of a class, or at least part of it.

Ex: "Software Engineering" for all the Software Engineering courses, or "Software" for both Software Engineering and Software Design Methods.

3. Search by course instructor:

Type in the name of an instructor that teaches a CUS class.

Ex: "Yadav", "Puya", "Christina", "Christoforou", or "Bonnie"

4. Search by course level:

Type in either "Undergraduate" to get the undergraduate courses, or "Graduate" to get the graduate courses.

5. Search by course instructor and level

This is a double query that can accept both instructor name and course level.

Ex: "Christoforou" and either "Graduate" to get his graduate offerings, or "Undergraduate" to get his two undergraduate offerings.

PLEASE NOTE: The search queries are case-sensitive, so the searches need to be properly capitalized to make the application work.
