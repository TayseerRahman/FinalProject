# FinalProject
My name is Tayseer Rahman, and this is my final project for CUS1172 - Web Application Development. To access this application, please use one of the two links presented here:

Heroku: https://cus1172finalproject.herokuapp.com/demo/index_dev.html

The page features 5 query searches, which works as follows:
1. Search by course code
2. Search by course title
3. Search by course instructor
4. Search by course level
5. Search by course instructor and level

These queries work by having the user enter a value related to the query. For instance, you would search "CUS1172" in course code, or "Robotics" for title, or "Yadav" for instructor.cThe only exception here is the 5th query, which is a combined search query utilizing the instructor name and course level. For that one, you need to enter both values to make it work. That is essentially how this course search application should function.
